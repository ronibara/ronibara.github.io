	        	<p class="smally">At Uber, I had the privilege to conduct evaluative and generative research on the rider trip experience. The TripEx team owns the experience from the moment you request your ride to the moment you step out of the vehicle and rate & tip.</p>
	        	<p class="smally"><strong>*This work is subject to a Non-Disclosure Agreement,</strong> so I cannot share any further information than what’s on this page; nevertheless, I would love to chat and share the professional lessons that I learned along the way!</p>

	        	<!-- <p class="smally">For my first project, I led 12 usability sessions to assess the app's information architecture during a rider's trip experience. From these sessions, I drew 9 foundational insights and developed 6 actionable design recommendations. 41 stakeholders visited my deck after I shared it.

	        	<p class="smally">For my first project, I led 12 usability sessions to assess the app’s information architecture during a rider’s trip experience. From these sessions, I drew 9 foundational insights around how riders prioritize trip information during each phase of their trip. After sharing my findings, 41 stakeholders visited my report deck, and 6 of my recommendations were implemented into the 2023 H1 TripEx roadmap. I can't wait to see these recommendations impact the experience of 90+ million riders, and I couldn’t be more thankful to my manager and mentor for giving me the opportunity, support, and sense of agency.</p><!-- Following these insights, I developed 6 actionable design recommendations to wrap up my report deck; in the 4 weeks following my share-out, 41 stakeholders visited my deck. -->
	        	<!-- <p class="smally">Personally, it was really cool to see this continued interest, but what makes me even happier is seeing my 6 recommendations​​ implemented into the 2023 H1 TripEx roadmap. In the coming year, I can’t wait to see these recommendations impact the experience of 90+ million riders, and I couldn’t be more thankful to my manager and mentor for giving me the opportunity, support, and sense of agency.</p> -->

	        	<!-- <p class="smally">I continued to work on the trip experience in my second project, conducting a diary study on dScout with 21 participants to capture their perceptions of advertisements while on the move. I organized 430+ photo and video entries, resulting in 3 insights and 9 attitudinal patterns. I presented these findings by outlining a framework of 12+ tenets and traps to inform the Sales, Product, Brand, and Ads teams. I'm proud of how I aligned visions from different stakeholders for this area of work. The people and projects I worked with during this internship were a dream come true as a UX researcher.</p> -->

	        	<p class="smally">I continued to work on the trip experience in my second project, conducting a diary study on dScout with 21 participants to capture their perceptions of advertisements while on the move. During the study, I organized 430+ photo and video entries, which culminated into 3 high-level insights and 9 attitudinal patterns. Before wrapping up my internship, I presented these findings by outlining a framework of 12+ tenets and traps to inform the Sales, Product, Brand, and Ads teams about rider discovery opportunities.</p>
	        	<!-- <p class="smally">In hindsight, I’m most proud of how I aligned visions from different stakeholders for this area of work. At one point, I introduced the TripEx team to a related field of work at Uber that they hadn’t been aware of beforehand; along the same vein, I looped in managers from different circles of the company throughout my project to learn from their insightful perspectives. Altogether, the people and projects that I had the pleasure to work with during this internship was truly a dream come true in my life as a UX researcher. </p> -->

<!-- 	        		<h1>Problem</h1>
	        		<h2>Challenge</h2>
	        		<p class="smally">Freestyling is the artistic practice where rappers improvise lyrics on the spot. From vibing with friends to recording yourself alone, freestyling is useful for general fun, practicing your craft, or even gaining inspiration for songwriting.</p>
	        		<p class="smally">There’s a lot of small issues around freestyling. First, freestyling can produce some legendary moments, yet they’re often left uncaptured. These legendary moments might take place with a copywrighted beat, which causes legal issues as it is unfair to the original DJ. When recording freestyles, it currently requires using a multitude of apps, and these recordings usually lack sound quality. Lastly, for rappers that love freestyling, it tends to take some time to find a beat that fits their style.</p>
	        		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	        		<p class="smally">DJs want a promising way to spread their beats so that it can be found by rappers in pursuit of beats. Young-adult rappers want an encouraging way to freestyle so that they can enjoy and practice the art form.</p>

	        		<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
	        		<h2>Be a research partner, not a research resource</h2>

	        		<!-- <p class="smally"> These are some of the many wise words from my manager, Kendall Avery. I have come across this lesson throughout the different phases of a project. Your stakeholders will have many asks and visions, but they appreciate your expertise and judgment around how grand a project can be supported. It's your responsibility to delegate work to your team, and it's a two-way street between you and your stakeholders. Don't just answer questions when you share your recommendations; ask them. How might the team move forward with these insights in mind?</p> -->

	        		<p class="smally"> <!-- These are some of the many wise words from my manager, Kendall Avery, and I've resonated with this lesson at various stages of a project's life cycle. --> By nature, I like to make everyone happy; however, this sentiment can be an obstacle to your project scope and the quality of your insights. While teammates may have many <em>asks</em>, they are far more understanding than you could ever imagine, so having the agency to set boundaries with your time is expected, even if setting it seems scary at first. This sets a precedent that you are a research partner, not a resource, and establishes a two-way street between you and your stakeholders, which goes a long way in working as a team to answer research questions.</p>
	        			<!-- I have come across this lesson all throughout the different phases of a project, from scoping to share-out. First, your stakeholders will have many asks, and just as many visions; in the end, however, they appreciate <i>your</i> expertise, and your judgment around how grand of a project can be supported. Once you’re up and running, it is also your responsibility to delegate work to your team; it’s a two-way street between you and your stakeholders. Along this same vein, don’t just <i>answer</i> questions when you share your recommendations; ask them! How might the team move forward with these insights in mind?</p> -->
					<!-- <h2>Inspiration finds you, but only when you’re working</h2>
	        		<p class="smally">I came across this feeling all throughout my internship. On a day-to-day basis, doing your home<i>work</i> might mean coming to each meeting with a yes-or-no question to ask. From project to project, inspiration came immediately during my background lit review, where elements of past study designs lived on to inspire my own. In the office itself, hard work included energizing my friends in the Paris section of Floor 4, Mission Bay 3; this energy reflected back onto me, as these friends became idols of mine from their love, support, and help introducing me to new stakeholders. </p>
	        		<p class="smally">Altogether, hard work in a fast environment champions running with inspiration, and looking back, it’s cool to think of the different directions that the project took thanks to little moments in the day. Moving forward, I’m confident that whatever direction my career path takes, I’ll enjoy the ride as long as I continue <i>doing</i> what I love.</p> -->
	        		
	        		<h2>Listening helps sharpen your toolkit</h2>

	        		<!-- <p class="smally"> As an extrovert, I saw a growth opportunity in learning to listen more, especially during research sessions. I also used my listening skills to find inspiration from how a PM frames a problem and to empower my designers' ideas. I learned to share early and often and to ask for feedback. I'm excited to continue listening to my peers and idols and can't thank Uber enough for all of the learnings I've gained from them.</p> -->

	        		<p class="smally">I like to talk a lot, but as a user researcher at Uber, I'm given all the resources in the world so that I can perfect one thing: listening. In particular, I'm to listen to riders, so I can voice their perspectives. Beyond research sessions, I've also learned how to listen during meetings, gaining inspiration from a PM's straightforward way to break down a problem, or a designer's creative idea for going about research. I consider these perspectives to be new tools under my belt, and I'm excited to continue listening to my peers and idols down the road. As I continue to listen, one takeaway to prioritize listening is to share early and often; there’s never a bad time to ask for feedback, and the more you do, the more effectively you’ll work in small chunks to crack at a big problem.</p>

	        			<!-- As an extrovert, I saw a growth opportunity in learning to listen more. On the surface, this is most obvious during research sessions. After all, at a place with so many research resources, operations, and bright minds, this help is for one thing: to preserve your energy for Uber riders themselves.  --><!-- During this internship, I learned how to listen beyond sessions, but during all stages of the research process. In team meetings, I found inspiration from how our PM frames problems, and used their framing as a way to organize background research. --><!-- ; adopting this terminology one framework from a meeting, I organized all of my background research sources using a <i>What – So What – Now What – Woah!</i> framework. --> <!-- Meanwhile, when designing a study itself, I found value from hearing the creative visions of product designers, --> <!-- empowering those visions to become made sure to let <i>design fuel UXR</i>, empowering my designers’ idea --><!-- which culminated in a photo-based storyboard behind an interactive prototype.</p> -->
	        		<!-- <p class="smally">One takeaway to prioritize listening is to share early and often; there’s never a bad time to ask for feedback, and the more you do, the more effectively you’ll work in small chunks to crack at a big problem.
